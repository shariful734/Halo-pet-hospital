            <h3>As a new client, you can expect our full attention to your pets’ needs with courtesy and respect.</h3>

                When you arrive for your appointment, you will be greeted warmly, and will be ushered into an examination room as soon as we have one available. (Our goal is to see all of our clients and patients on time, and although we have contingencies for emergencies, there will be times where the unexpected will create delays. We will ensure these are minimized as much as possible.

            <p>
                Patients having surgery must be dropped off the night before surgery. The reason for this is to ensure ACCESS staff have the appropriate labwork so that  correct anesthetic protocols cane be created specifically for your pet.  Often, additional labwork may be drawn the night before  surgery to allow enough time for results to be returned.
            </p>

            <p>In addition, it is important for pets to become acclimated to their environment prior to surgery. Admitting patients the night before a surgical event gives the ACCESS staff time to monitor your pet for normal urination, bowel movements, as well as ensuring that food intake is limited appropriately prior to anesthesia.</p>

            <p>
                Most importantly, the comfort of your pet is of utmost concern to us. Pain control is most effective when medications are started before a surgical procedure, which in some  cases, may need to be up to twelve hours in advance to achieve adequate levels of a pain relief medication in a patient’s system.

            <h5 className="fw-bold"> Post-Operative Information</h5>

            <p>
                ACCESS has detailed crate confinement information available to you. Be sure that you are fully aware of all of the restrictions specific to your pet to ensure the best possible surgical outcome for your pet.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because of various pain medications that may be used for the comfort of your pet, it is not unusual for patients to become constipated post-operatively. If constipation persists for longer than 5 days give our office a call. Adding Metamucil® or canned pumpkin to the diet when your pet arrives home may help prevent constipation. Additionally, some patients may not urinate for the first 24 hours. Do not worry, just keep walking them to the designated urination spot. They can’t hold it forever.
